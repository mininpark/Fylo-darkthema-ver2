## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
From this project, I tried to use Bootstrap 4 for showing optimal layout for the site depending on uses's device screen size. But when it comes to media query to set, I had a trouble with changing flex option of Bootstrap. So in this project, I only adjusted minimal Bootstrap settings. 

### Continued development

Sutiable changing with Bootstrap 4 with media query
